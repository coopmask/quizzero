# Quizzero

Quizzero is my attempt at a trivia app where a player's score is kept track of at the top of the application, and termination of the quiz is met with the user's final score. A correct answer is met with a green background, an incorrect answer is followed by a red background, and a yellow background shadows the site at the end. The site is fully responsive and mobile-friendly. The motivation for this project was to create an app that could be easily used and enjoyed, and I felt that I would gain experience by keeping track of a score, showing correct answers when inputting a wrong answer, and pulling in data from an API (the quiz questions).
